Requested by:  Dr. Mohammed El-Ramly in Structured Programming course.

Purpose: 
----------------------
This program provides a collection of ciphers and deciphering algorithms for text encryption and decryption. Each cipher has its own unique properties and uses different techniques to transform plain text into cipher text and vice versa. The available ciphers in this program are:

. Affine Cipher
. Caesar Cipher
. Atbash Cipher
. Vigenere Cipher
. Baconian Cipher
. Simple Substitution Cipher
. Polybius Square Cipher
. Morse Code
. XOR Cipher
. Rail-fence Cipher

Note:
------------------------
Each cipher or decipher program is implemented in a separate file.

Usage:
------------------------
To use this program, follow the steps below:

1- Run the program by compiling and executing the source code.
2- You will be prompted with a menu that lists the available ciphers and decipher programs.
3- Enter the corresponding number for the cipher or decipher program you want to use.
4- The selected cipher or decipher program will be executed.
5- After completing the encryption or decryption process, you will be asked to choose whether to continue using the program or exit.
6- Enter 1 to continue and choose another cipher or decipher program.
7- Enter 2 to exit the program.
